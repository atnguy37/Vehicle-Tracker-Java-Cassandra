# Vehicle-Tracker-Java-Cassandra
 **Java Web Application** with **Tomcat** and **Cassandra** to track a vehicle via based on Date and Vehicle ID <br />
 This is a project of my Udemy course "Getting Started With Apache Cassandra" (https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-cassandra/) <br />
## Description
 • I tried to build a **Java Web Application** with **Tomcat** to track a vehicle via based on Date and Vehicle ID and showed vehicle’s coordinate in Google Map and its information. <br />
 • I enhance the project by seting up two **Cassandra Cluster** with **4 nodes** using **AWS EC2** to communicate with Web Server via Java.
